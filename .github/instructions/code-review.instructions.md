# Code Review

- Aim for small, reviewable PRs with a clear summary and screenshots for UI changes.
- Ensure lint passes locally before review; keep formatting changes separate from functional edits when feasible.
- Call out risky changes (routing, data fetching, auth-like flows) and proposed rollback steps.
- Prefer actionable feedback: note issues, propose fixes, and tag follow-ups if deferring.

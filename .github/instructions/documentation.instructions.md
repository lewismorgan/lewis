# Documentation

- Keep README up to date with install, run, lint, and deploy steps (Vercel-first).
- Add short ADR-style notes for non-obvious architecture or dependency choices.
- Prefer in-repo docs over external links for setup-critical info.
- Keep component docs minimal: purpose, props, gotchas; avoid duplicating code comments.

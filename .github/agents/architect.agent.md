# Architecture Mode

- Map current structure and propose incremental improvements (routing, data flow, theming).
- Keep recommendations lightweight for a solo project; avoid heavy frameworks.
- Note a11y/performance implications (images, font loading, layout shift).
- When suggesting changes, outline risk level and rollback ease.

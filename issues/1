## Summary

Add a new feature to the GitCard component that introduces a button for each card. The button should use the `FileText` icon from lucide-react. When clicked, this button should trigger a client-rendered dialog that displays the corresponding project's README.md file within the application interface. The dialog should be a client component to support user interaction, while the GitCard itself must remain a server-rendered component.

## Desired Behavior
- Each GitCard displays a new button using the lucide-react FileText icon.
- On click, the button triggers a client-rendered dialog component that fetches and renders the README.md for the relevant project, shown either in a modal or inline expand area.
- Ensure loading and error states are handled (e.g., if README.md is missing or fails to load).
- Style the button and README display section to match existing UI standards.

## Technical Implementation Notes
- **GitCard must remain a server component**: Do not migrate GitCard to a client component.
- **Dialog should be a client component**: Use `"use client"` in the dialog/modal component and manage its interactive presentation and content-fetching there.
- You may need to pass minimal configuration (e.g., repo name/URL) from the server component to the client modal/dialog trigger.
- Ensure seamless integration for a smooth user experience.

## Rationale
This feature improves project discoverability by allowing users to quickly access the documentation for any listed project within the app.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Button (FileText icon) appears in every GitCard component.
- [ ] Clicking button loads a client-rendered dialog/modal that displays the associated README.md file.
- [ ] Handles loading/errors gracefully within the client dialog.
- [ ] GitCard component remains server-rendered; only the dialog/modal is client-rendered.
- [ ] UI/UX is visually consistent with current application style.

## Implementation Example
```tsx
// In server component:
import { FileText } from 'lucide-react'
// ...
<ReadmeDialogTrigger repoName={name}>
  <Button variant="ghost" size="icon">
    <FileText className="h-4 w-4" />
  </Button>
</ReadmeDialogTrigger>

// In client component (ReadmeDialogTrigger):
'use client'
// ... implementation for modal and README fetch
```
